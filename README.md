A lightweight macOS menu bar app for quick note capture. Jot down thoughts instantly with a global keyboard shortcut — notes are saved as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter to any folder you choose. Works great with Obsidian, Logseq, or any Markdown-based note system.

## Features

- Global shortcut (Cmd+Shift+N) to capture notes from anywhere
- Saves notes as Markdown with optional YAML frontmatter tags
- Works great with Obsidian, Logseq, or any Markdown-based note system
- Configurable save directory and default tag
- Floating panel with frosted glass appearance
- Runs as a menu bar app (no Dock icon)

## Install

```bash
